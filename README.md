# ADSRFilter
This program takes as input a mono .dat audio file, preferably a simple tone or group of tones.  The Program filters the signal,
modelling it after an ADSR envelope.  The result is a synthesizer-like sound with the attack, decay, sustain and release that
an acoustic musical instrument produces.
